# Triangle Chaos Game
This simple code creates triangle fractals by using the chaos theory.

### Steps of the game:
1. Pick a random point in the triangle and mark it.
1. Pick a random corner.
1. Mark the midpoint of the corner and the previously marked point.
1. Take the midpoint as the new point.
1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until it makes a goofy triangle fractal.

### Requirements
Python Turtle is required to run this code. Simply install it with`pip install PythonTurtle`

### Sample runs

#### First run:
First run was made with 3.000 points with diameter of 5 pixels. It took 831 seconds (~14 minutes) on my computer. (Yes first run was not centered :P)

#### Fourth run:
Fourth run was made with 30000 points with diameter of 3 pixels for that extra crispiness. It took 9611 seconds (~160 minutes) on my computer.
